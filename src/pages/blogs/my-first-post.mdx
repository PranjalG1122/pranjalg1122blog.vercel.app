## My first blog post! ðŸŽ‰

Hooray! I've finally created my first blog post using Astro. I've been meaning to create a blog
for a while now, and I'm glad I finally got around to it. I'll be using this blog to write about
my projects, and maybe even some tutorials. I'll also be using this blog to write about my
experiences with different technologies, and maybe even some tutorials. But the main purpose will
be to write about what I learn about any new technology I come across. It will help me to better understand
and remember the concepts I learn, and it will also help others who are learning the same thing.

## But why Astro?

I choose Astro for a variety of reasons. But if I had to boil it down, I'd say it's because of three
particular reasons:

- It's **blazingly** fast: Astro was purpose built for content heavy sites in mind. Since it focuses mainly
  on serverside rendering, it can load pages much quicker than other frameworks. It also has a built in
  static site generator, which means that it can be deployed as a static site, which is even faster.
- It's a versatile framework: By that I mean it can support a variety of integrations, such as Vue, React, Svelte
  (I used Svelte for this blog), and even vanilla JS. It also supports styling integrations such as Sass, Tailwind, etc.
- It's easy to use: Astro is a very easy framework to use. It's very easy to get started with, and it's
  very easy to learn. The layouts are easy to implement with and are convinient as they encourage reusability
  of existing code. And once everything has been set up, you just have to add a new markdown file and you've got another
  post.

## What did I use to make this blog?

As mentioned quite a few times before, the core framework is Astro. But I also used Svelte for reactive UI components.
Astro works on the concept of islands, which are certain parts of a page that are hydrated to allow for user interactivity.
For example, the navbar is usually interactive, such as a theme switcher or a button, but the rest of the page can be static
HTML. This is an example of partial hydration. For the interactive utilities, I used Svelte over Vue or React mainly
because I wanted to experience a new approach for frontend UI development.

For styling, I used Tailwind CSS. It's a much more convinient and quick way of styling a page over regular CSS. Using classes, it
makes it easier to know where each style on a component is added, rather than having to cycle to another file and searching there.
Tailwind is also a middle ground between CSS and Bootstrap. While CSS might offer more customizability in niche situations, the core
uses of it can be tedious. Bootstrap offers much more convinience, but lacks the ability to create more distinctive styles and also
creates a generic feeling website. Tailwind hits the sweet spot. It gives a list of predefined utility classes which are sensibly
designed, but also offers the ability to apply unique styles for those one in a thousand cases.
