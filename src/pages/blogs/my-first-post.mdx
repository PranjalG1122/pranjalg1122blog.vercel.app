## My first blog post! ðŸŽ‰

This blog was created using the Astro framework. I'm using the it to create this blog.
It's a static site generator that uses React components to generate HTML.
It's a great framework for creating blogs and websites. I'm using it to create this blog because it's fast,
easy to use, and has a great community. `hasndkjawnbida` bs
