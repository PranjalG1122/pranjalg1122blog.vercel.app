## What is SwiftSongs?

SwiftSongs is a custom built music player built for the web to play locally
uploaded songs. The web application was built using Javascript, React and
Tailwind CSS. It allows the user to play songs from a pre-defined selection of
tracks. Some of the main features of this application includes the ability to
play, pause, skip, shuffle, seek and loop songs. It also allows the user to
adjust the volume of the song. Upon changing the volume or seeking ahead in the
song, the progress bar updates accordingly. It also saves the last played song
and the volume level in the local storage so that the user can resume from where
they left off. The playlist contains a list of 5 songs, with the credits of the
song artist and the song name.

## The `<audio>` tag

Since this was my first time interacting with the `<audio>` tag, I had to become
acquainted with it. It is used to embed sound content in a document. It can be
used to play audio files directlyfrom the web or from the local storage.
