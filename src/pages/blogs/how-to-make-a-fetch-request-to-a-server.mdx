## Introduction

I'll be showing you how to make a fetch request using React, Express, Node.js
and cor. There are many applications of making a fetch request, such as
accessing and handling data from an API, authentication for user registration
and login, and many more. In this tutorial, we'll mainly focus on sending a
request to our custom server and handling the response.

## Frontend

We'll use Vite as its development environment is fast, especially compared to
'Create-React-App'. We'll ignore any templates as they introduce redundant
boilerplate code and unwanted styles. We'll also use Typescript as introducing
predefined types will help with debugging in the later stages. We'll use `pnpm`
as it a much more optimised package manager, but using `npm` or `yarn` is also
fine. To start, let's create a new directory called 'client' in your root
directory (make sure to choose 'React' and 'Typescript' in the options when
creating a Vite project):

```bash
pnpm create vite client react-ts
cd client
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

Head over to your `App.tsx` file and remove all the boilerplate in between the
outermost `<div></div>`, as well as any unnecessary imports. We'll then add a
button element which has a `onClick` event listener which will call a function
called `handleFetch`. It should look something like this:

```js
import "./App.css";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <button onClick={handleFetch}>Fetch</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Sending a request from the Frontend

For the frontend, we'll define a function `handleFetch` which will be called
everytime we want to make a request to the server. We use async/await to make
the function asynchorous so that the function will wait for the response from
the server. Async functions have three responses: pending, resolved, and
rejected. Pending is the state when the request has been sent, but no
appropriate response has been received. Resolved is when the response has been
received and the request has been fulfilled. Rejected is when the request has
been rejected by the server, since a particular condition has not been met. An
async function runs on a seperate thread until the response has achieved one of
the three states.

The fetch function has two parameters: the url and an object containing the
method, headers, and body. The method is the type of request we want to make,
which in this case is a **GET** request. There are many other types of requests
such as **POST**, **PUT**, **DELETE**, etc. We use
`"Content-Type": "application/json",` as we want to send specify what type of
format we want our data to be in. In this case, we want it to be in JSON format.

`.then()` is a function which runs once the function that it is attached to has
executed. In this case, we convert the incoming response to JSON format and then
log it to the console. We use `.catch()` as it handles any errors that may
occur. In this case, we log the error to the console.

```js
const handleFetch = () => {
  fetch("http://localhost:5000/ping", {
    method: "GET",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
  })
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then((data) => {
      console.log(data);
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      console.log(err);
    });
};
```

## Backend

### Setting up the server

For the backend, create another directory called 'server' in your root
directory. We'll first create a `package.json` file using `pnpm init` and then
install the dependecies:

```bash
pnpm install express cors ts-node typescript nodemon
pnpm install @types/cors @types/express @types/node
```

In your server directory, create a new file called `index.ts`. Head over to your
`package.json` and change the "main" to "index.ts". Under "scripts", create a
new script, "start":

```json
 "scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon"
  },
```

Now, we'll create a basic Express server. Head over to your `index.ts` file and
add the following code:

```js
import cors from "cors";
import express from "express";
import { Request, Response } from "express";

const app = express();

app.use(express.json());
app.use(cors());
app.options("*", cors());

app.listen(5000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on port 3000");
});
```

We are importing cors and Express and then creating an instance of Express
called `app`. We use the `app.use()` function as it mounts the middleware to any
route throughout the server as it processes the request. These middleware layers
run everytime a route is called and execute some function. In our case, we are
using `app.use(express.json())` as it recognizes the incoming data from the
frontend and converts it to a json object. `app.listen()` is used to bind itself
to a specific port and listen for any connections. Its options include a port
number and a callback function which is executed once the server is running. To
test and run the server, run the following command. You should see your message
being logged to the console.

```bash
pnpm start
```

### Creating a test route

We will now creat a test route, which will send a response to the frontend. We
use `app.get()` as it specifically handles GET requests. The first parameter is
the route, and the second parameter is a callback function which takes in a
request and a response. The request is the incoming request from the frontend,
and the response is the response that we want to send back to the frontend. We
use `res.json()` as it sends a response back to the frontend in json format. In
this case, we are sending a string called "pong". The final code should look
like this:

```js
app.get("/ping", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.json({ message: "pong" });
});
```

### Testing

Everything is set up! Run an instance of both your client and your sever on
seperate terminals. You should see the following message in your browser
console:

```js
{
  message: "pong";
}
```
